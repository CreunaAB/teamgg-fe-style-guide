# General
* Use double quotes, not single.
* Don't use inline styles
* Use `alt` attributes for `img`s.


### Semantics
* Use HTML according to its purpose. HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation is solely the responsibility of CSS.
* Use heading tags appropriately. Heading tags should denote site structure. `<h1>` is the main heading, `<h2>`, `<h3>` and so on are subheadings.
* Items in list form should always be housed in a `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<dl>`, never a set of `<div>`s or `<p>`s.
* Don't use tables for page layout - only for tabular data.
* Don't use `<section>` arbitrarily. `<section>` represents a generic document or application section and should contain a heading.
