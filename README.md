# Front End Style Guide for Team GG

This Frontend Style Guide contains best practices and basic frontend rules to apply when working on a Team GG project. Rules are created to ensure cohesion in the code produced, to ease maintainability and give a common and known structure to work on.

We aim at producing something that will be able to grow and scale, while keeping it human readable and understandable for a newcomer. A balance between speed, ease and simplicity.
