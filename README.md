# Front End Style Guide

This Front End Style Guide contains best practices and basic front end rules. Rules are created to ensure cohesion in the code produced, to ease maintainability and give a common and known structure to work on.

We aim at producing something that will be able to grow and scale, while keeping a strong focus on readability. If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style.
