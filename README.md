# Front End Style Guide for Chalmers intranet

This Front End Style Guide contains best practices and basic front end rules to apply when working on Chalmers intranet. Rules are created to ensure cohesion in the code produced, to ease maintainability and give a common and known structure to work on.

We aim at producing something that will be able to grow and scale, while keeping a strong focus on readability. If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style.
